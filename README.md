## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker (recommended)
- Node.js >=14.0.0 (for local development)

### Option 1: Docker (For Dummies)

```sh
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v ./data:/app/data dumbwareio/dumbassets:latest
```

1. Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
2. Add assets, upload photos/receipts, and track warranties
3. Celebrate how dumb easy this was

### Option 2: Docker Compose (For Dummies who like customizing)

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  dumbassets:
    container_name: dumbassets
    image: dumbwareio/dumbassets:latest
    ports: 
      - 3000:3000
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      PORT: ${DUMBASSETS_PORT:-3000}
      NODE_ENV: ${DUMBASSETS_NODE_ENV:-production}
      DEBUG: ${DUMBASSETS_DEBUG:-true}
      SITE_TITLE: ${DUMBASSETS_SITE_TITLE:-DumbAssets}
      BASE_URL: ${DUMBASSETS_BASE_URL:-http://localhost:3000}
      DUMBASSETS_PIN: ${DUMBASSETS_PIN:-1234}
      ALLOWED_ORIGINS: ${DUMBASSETS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS:-*}
      APPRISE_URL: ${DUMBASSETS_APPRISE_URL:-}
      # ...other env vars
```

Then run:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

1. Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
2. Add and manage your assets

### Option 3: Running Locally (For Developers)
