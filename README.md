## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker (recommended)
- Node.js >=14.0.0 (for local development)

### Option 1: Docker (For Dummies)

```sh
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v ./data:/app/data dumbwareio/dumbassets:latest
```

1. Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
2. Add assets, upload photos/receipts, and track warranties
3. Celebrate how dumb easy this was

### Option 2: Docker Compose (For Dummies who like customizing)

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  dumbassets:
    container_name: dumbassets
    image: dumbwareio/dumbassets:latest
    ports: 
      - 3000:3000
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      PORT: ${DUMBASSETS_PORT:-3000}
      NODE_ENV: ${DUMBASSETS_NODE_ENV:-production}
      DEBUG: ${DUMBASSETS_DEBUG:-true}
      SITE_TITLE: ${DUMBASSETS_SITE_TITLE:-DumbAssets}
      BASE_URL: ${DUMBASSETS_BASE_URL:-http://localhost:3000}
      DUMBASSETS_PIN: ${DUMBASSETS_PIN:-1234}
      ALLOWED_ORIGINS: ${DUMBASSETS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS:-*}
      APPRISE_URL: ${DUMBASSETS_APPRISE_URL:-}
      DEMO_MODE: ${DUMBASSETS_DEMO_MODE:-false}
      # ...other env vars
```

Then run:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

1. Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
2. Add and manage your assets

### Option 3: Running Locally (For Developers)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DumbAssets.git
cd DumbAssets
npm install
npm start
```

Open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

- üß© Add components and sub-components
- üñºÔ∏è Upload and store photos and receipts
- üîç Search by name, model, serial, or description
- üè∑Ô∏è Hierarchical organization of components
- üìÖ Warranty expiration notifications (configurable)
- üîî Apprise notification integration
- üåó Light/Dark mode with theme persistence
- üõ°Ô∏è PIN authentication with brute force protection
- üì¶ Docker support for easy deployment
- üîí **Demo Mode**: Read-only demonstration mode for showcasing
- **Direct Asset Linking**: Notifications now include clickable links that directly open the specific asset in your browser

## Demo Mode

Demo mode provides a read-only version of DumbAssets perfect for demonstrations, showcasing, or public instances. When enabled:

- **Backend**: All modifying HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) are blocked
- **Frontend**: All buttons, forms, and file uploads are disabled
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear "DEMO" badge and notices inform users of the read-only state
- **User Experience**: Friendly messages explain why actions are disabled

### Enabling Demo Mode

Set the environment variable:
```bash
DEMO_MODE=true
```

Or in Docker Compose:
```yaml
environment:
  DEMO_MODE: true
```

When demo mode is active, the site title will automatically include "(DEMO)" and users will see visual indicators throughout the interface.

## Direct Asset Linking

When you receive notifications (warranty expiring, asset added/edited, maintenance due), they now include direct links to view the specific asset. Simply click the "üîó View Asset" link in the notification to be taken directly to that asset's details page.

### URL Format
- Main assets: `yoursite.com?ass=asset-id`  
- Sub-assets: `yoursite.com?ass=parent-id&sub=sub-asset-id`

### Configuration
To use this feature, set the `BASE_URL` environment variable to your domain:
```bash
BASE_URL=https://assets.yourcompany.com
```

If not set, it defaults to `http://localhost:3000`.
